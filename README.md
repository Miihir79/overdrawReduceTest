# overdrawReduceTest
In this project I aimed to reduce the unecessary re-drawing of certain sections of our screen, thus improving the overall performance of the app.

here are some samples of howmuch a single line of code can effect redraws:
<table>
  <tr>    
    <td>with overdraw <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66465511/174018613-3937334a-8f5e-4243-b175-3c50053fb2f7.jpg" width ="350">
    <td>without overdraw <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66465511/174018622-a2d02d47-374d-4336-8672-c06a9d844edf.jpg" width="350">
  </tr>
</table>
